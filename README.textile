h1. sopr-activity

A simple script for downloading lobbying activity disclosure forms from the Senate Office for Public Records.

This is a work in progress and is not yet complete. One day I would like it to plug into a Django app.

Right now, it'll download the latest data for you, which might be nice if you just want a big csv dump, or a big list of all the lobbyists or whatever.
